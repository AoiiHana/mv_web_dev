			Welcome to this test page! Here you will find some basic examples of HTML elements and how they may be implemented.
			You're probably reading this in basic Times New Roman on a white background, aren't you? Unfortunately we haven't gone into depth about how to add CSS elements just yet. 
			Personally, though, I don't mind the simplicity. It feels nostalgic, almost. 
			Oh, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

			Was that nice? I certainly hope it was.
			I'm afraid I have to go now. But please remember, no matter where we may be or who you are, the Code Fairies love you very much.
			Please take care. We'll always be here waiting for you!
