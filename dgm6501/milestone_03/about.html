            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>PetsFirst is a non-profit organization dedicated to rescuing and rehoming pets in need. Founded in 2025, our mission is to provide shelter, medical care, and loving homes for abandoned and neglected animals. We believe that every pet deserves a second chance at life and are committed to making that a reality.</p>
            <p>Unlike other shelter organizations, we are entirely virtual, relying primarily on a network of volunteers and staff to house and care for pets in their own homes. Our web-first model, unique in the field, allows us to give animals and prospective adopters unprecedented levels of flexibility and individual comfort that wouldn't be possible in a traditional shelter setting. Our team consists of passionate animal lovers who work tirelessly to ensure the well-being of the pets in our care. From organizing adoption events to providing educational resources for pet owners, we strive to create a community that values and supports animal welfare.</p>
            <p>We rely on the generosity of donors and volunteers to continue our work. If you would like to support our cause, please consider making a donation or volunteering your time. Together, we can make a difference in the lives of countless pets.</p>
